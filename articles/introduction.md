# Introduction to DocumentDB

DocumentDB is an open-source document database engine that makes it easy to store, search, and manage data in a flexible way. Think of it as a friendly blend of a traditional database and a modern NoSQL system, all powered by PostgreSQL.

## What makes DocumentDB special?
- **Document-Oriented:** Store your data as documents (like JSON), making it easy to model real-world information.
- **PostgreSQL Foundation:** Built on the trusted PostgreSQL database, so you get reliability and performance out of the box.
- **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and contribute toâ€”no strings attached.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Run it on your laptop, in the cloud, or on your own servers.

## How does it work?
DocumentDB adds support for BSON (a binary form of JSON) to PostgreSQL, letting you use powerful document features alongside all the tools and features you already know from Postgres. You can create collections, run queries, and even do advanced things like full-text search and aggregations.

Whether you're building a new app or just exploring, DocumentDB is designed to be approachable and fun to use.
